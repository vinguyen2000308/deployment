Using yaml file
- K8s resources are stored in the Etcd database in Json Format - all of config
- YAML is more human friendly
- YAML: relations between objects are defined by using indentation -> not use tab bt spaces for indentation
- When working with YAML in K8s, the API specifications are followed -> kubectl explain to figure out which
elements are required
- Using kubectl create -f my_resource_file.yaml to create the resources or kubectl delete -f my_resource_file.yml
to delete the resources
- Generate YAML code: kubectl get <resource> -o yaml > my_resource.yml


1. In the file yaml:
- apiVersion: later
- kind: type of resource here is pod
-  metadata:
    name: name
    namespace: optional
- spec:
    containers:
    - name: busy
      image: busybox
      command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
    - name: ...
2. Working with the API
    - kubectl api-resource shows a list of resource that is defined in the API
    - kubectl api-versions shows resource versions
    - kubectl explain
IMPORTANT:
 - API group

kubectl get deployments.apps
