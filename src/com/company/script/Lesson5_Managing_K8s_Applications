0. What is Pods ?
- How many pods on a single node ?

1. Managing Pods
- There are no good ways to just start a Pod from the command line -> deprecated -> remove soon
- Recommended: start from yaml file: kubectl create -f resource.yaml
    + apiVersion
    + kind
    + metadata
    + container
- Command:
    kubectl get pods show currently running Pods
    kubectl describe pods show details about a Pod
    kubectl get pods <podname> -o -yaml show yaml specification of the Pod as it is currently running in the Etcd cluster db
    kubectl delete pods mypod will delete a Pod
