1. Check cgroup version
    grep cgroup /proc/filesystems
=> If your system supports cgroupv2, you would see
    nodev   cgroup
    nodev   cgroup2
On a system with only cgroupv1, you would only see:
    nodev   cgroup
2. What is a systemd ?
3. What is a cgroup, cgroupfs ?
4. What is cri-dockerd ?


Step 2: Install Docker Engine
- On each of your nodes, install Docker for your Linux distribution
- Install cri-dockerd
    + Download file rpm: https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd/releases with latest version

    + Convert file rpm -> deb
            apt-get install alien dpkg-dev debhelper build-essential
            alien name_of_file
    + Install deb file
            alien cri-dockerd-0.2.1.20220525024524.cb92d7b-0.el7.x86_64.rpm
    + Verify: cri-dockerd v




Install rpm:  apt install rpm
